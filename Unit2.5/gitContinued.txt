In this unit we add comments to existing code. And learn more about git and GitHub 

// for single line

/* 
for block code
 */


To push to your repo, you do the following commands 

git add . 
git commit -m " pushing code " 
git push 

be sure to include the dot(.) when adding and the double quotes around the message for the commit. 





----------------------------------------------------------------
for advance git you can add and commit at the same time: 
in your terminal type the following: 
git commit -a -m " message to all" 
^ that will add and commit at the same time. 
Than you push. Only do this if you have a strong understanding of git.
